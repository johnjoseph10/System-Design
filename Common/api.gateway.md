- Prevents abuse or overuse of services.
- Example: Limit users to 100 requests per minute.

### 4. **Caching**
- Stores responses temporarily to improve performance and reduce load.

### 5. **Load Balancing**
- Distributes traffic across multiple instances to ensure stability and scalability.

### 6. **Transformation**
- Converts request/response formats.
- Example: XML ‚Üí JSON or modifying headers.
